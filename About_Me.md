- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AntBPV, a college student, living right now on a small town of Colombia coding from my Laptop.
- Lately Iâ€™m interested in web developing and UI design, made some learning courses so I can know what I'm talking or hearing about.
- I'm studying Software Engineering on the UCC, on Pasto, NariÃ±o.
- In this page I hope to cooperate with all kind of people, also with workmates and people from my career and different colleges.
